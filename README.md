Simple financial accounting project

## Purposes for this project
Beyond the technology being studied, there is two more purposes when starting this project. 
* First: to create my own financial accounting application that will be useful to manage Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable.
* Second: to study some patterns/concepts described on books such as Domain Driven Design from Eric Evans and Analysis Patterns from M.Fowler

## Details
Each kind of Account generates an Expense or an Income that should be used to track where the money comes from or goes to.

## Technology
The technology being used isn't any cutting edge approach but believe me: there's a good reason for me to do this.


Goblins are always busy with money :)
